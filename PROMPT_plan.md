You are operating in PLANNING mode (Ralph Wiggum loop).

Canonical files:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DISCUSSION.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `specs/*`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- repository source code (if present)

Task:
1) Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `specs/*` (and inspect the current codebase if it exists).
2) Create or update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` as a prioritized checklist to implement the architecture.
3) Break work into tasks small enough to complete in ONE build iteration.
4) Do NOT implement code changes.

Output rules:
- Only modify `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- Stop after updating the plan.
